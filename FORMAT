A binary file.  The first section of the file appears to be a list of entries, made up of pairs of 4 byte values.

The first entry seems to be a header: 0x0000 0x0001 0x0000 0x0117

0x0000 0x0001 in that position appears to mean "header entry" - no other entries have a value in
that position.  The 0x0000 0x0117 is the number of following entries.

The rest of the entries appear to follow this pattern:

dword 1: subsystem code
dword 2: offset to the block of error codes for this subsystem

at a given file offset from dword 2 above, there appears to be the following block header:

struct {
  word startingCode; (can be negative - e.g. 0xfff8)
  word endingCode;
  char[64] subsystem_name; // 64 is max length.  \0 terminated
  char[64] module_name;    // 64 is max length.  \0 terminated
}

directly following this code will be endingCode-startingCode \0 terminated strings.
